main.tf is the first Terraform file I created. 


Objective:

create a Terraform file that creates two t2.micro ec2 instances in my AWS account (success)



Note: 

Both the ssh key and the security group are needed in order to successfully ssh into either machine.

I created an instance state object to be able to start and stop the ec2 instances.
